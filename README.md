# Python_Project2
My project 2, which is comparing DE gene expression in both a Meditation and Exercise study to find any correlation.

### Meditation data was found from:
  - This paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/tp2016164
  - Sage Bionetworks Synapse platform: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7058059/files/

### I used Gene Expression Omnibus to find the exercise dataset: 
  - This paper: https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.14814/phy2.15176
  - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE186045

Scientific Question: Are the biomarker effects that are shown in meditators associated with the exercise component of the yoga/meditation? In other words, does exercise have similar biomarker effects that meditation has, and could it be one of the factors behind meditation's short and long-term healthy aging effects?

Scientific Hypothesis: If the biomarker effects seen in meditation are from the exercise component of yoga, then DE genes from an exercise study would be similar to the meditation paper
