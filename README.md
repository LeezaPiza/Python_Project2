My project 2, which is comparing DE gene expression in both a Meditation and Exercise study to find any correlation.

  - This paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/tp2016164
  - Sage Bionetworks Synapse platform: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7058059/files/

I used Gene Expression Omnibus to find the exercise data:
